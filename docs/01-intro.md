# Introduction

AKA Profiles is a microapp that democratizes digital identity by being the easiest solution to adopt, while remaining decentralized and based on open standards (Nostr).

**Key Features**

- Creation of badges
- Automatic awarding of badges
- Custodian wallet containing multiple profiles for badge awards
- Ability for apps to re-use existing badges

## How It Works

We enable the automatic awarding of badges by providing a user workflow.
Apps redirect users to AKA Profiles to obtain the necessary badges.

**AKA Profiles:**

1. shows the list of badges required for access.
2. sends the user to the web pages where each badge can be awarded.
3. helps users create or select a profile to accept the badge awards.
