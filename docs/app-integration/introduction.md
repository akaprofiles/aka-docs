# Introduction

AKA Profiles offers a decentralized identity platform for application developers, focusing on user pseudo identities and reputations rather than real-life identities.

By leveraging existing user reputations, developers can streamline access to services and enhance user experiences without the need for siloed identity management within their applications.

This approach reduces friction and enables context-based experiences while eliminating the need for repetitive user verification.
