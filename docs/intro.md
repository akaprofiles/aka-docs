# Introduction

AKA Profiles awards user badges that any app can use to determine who can access special features and exclusive content.

Apps redirect users to AKA Profiles to obtain the necessary badges.

AKA Profiles:

1. shows the list of badges required for access.
2. sends the user to the webpages where each badge can be earned.
3. returns the user to the app after all badges are earned.

Apps can choose to select from the existing badges, or integrate new badges.
