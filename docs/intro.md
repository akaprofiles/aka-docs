# Introduction

AKA Profiles: Unlock exclusive features, content, and offers with Web3 digital badges and profiles.

## What is it?

**What is AKA Profiles?**

AKA Profiles keeps your real-world identity and digital profiles seperate, like a superhero's secret identity.
As a Web3 decentralized platform, users own their own profiles, and they can never be banned or revoked.

Profiles are completely public, allowing users to take their reputation with them across apps and websites with zero friction.

AKA Profiles is built on top of Nostr, the world's most censorship resistant social networking protocol.

## Who is it for?

Our web application supports users, creator / community managers, and application developers.

Users can

- create a digital profile and start getting badges
- have multiple profiles (work, play, etc.)
- use their profiles to get access to exclusive apps, services, content, or offers
- discover new offers

Creators / community managers can

- define eligibilty criteria to join their group / community
- enable automatic enrollment
- offer their community exclusive content, offers, or services

Application developers can

- create and publish hosted badges with eligiblity requirements
- control access to features or content based on badge awards
- let AKA Profiles handle user interactions required to meet eligiblity criteria
- re-use badges contributed by other developers

## Why We Exist

_it's simple..._

Tech monopolies abuse their power, banning user accounts based on opaque and often arbitrary reasons,
stripping individuals of their reputation and increasingy, their sources of income.

**We don't like that...**

Our motto is _Access without Identity_.

AKA Profiles enables users to take control over their online reputation, unlocking access to exclusive offers across multiple apps without having to expose their real-world identifies.

## Why Nostr?

The characteristics of the Nostr protocol make it ideal for our vision of how decentralized ~identity~ reputation should work.

- An "identity" can be a simple as single public/private key pair. No registration required, and any app or individual can generate their own keys.

- By default all information is shared, written across multiple relays (databases with different owners). This not only prevents censorship, but more importantly, enables re-use without prerequisite coordination.

- Simplicity of protocol make its highly extensible. Any developer can build on top of what we build, and things will still work.
