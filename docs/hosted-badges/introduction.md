# Introduction

Badges in AKA Profiles and like badges in real life. They awarded based on some criteria (usually an achievement) and distinguish the recipient. In AKA Profiles, a badge is awarded to a profile, and the owner of that profile remains anonymous. One person can have multiple profiles for different badges to further protect their real identity.

The web application supports both the creation and awarding of badges. Users are directed to a badge's award page, and if they meet the badge's eligibility criteria, the badge is awarded to their profile.
